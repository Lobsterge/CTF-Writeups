# RANDOM
![challenge](challenge.png)
### Challenge:
##### My random number generator, try to guess them l bet itâ€™s impossible.
##### Files: [random](random)

### Solution:
We have a simple binary where we have to guess 10 randomly generated numbers in a row to get a shell.
The seed of the random generator is based on the current time so we can simply make a [script](solve.py) and get our flag.
```bash
$ python3 solve.py
